# valley-escape-rpg
A vibe coded game based on Wasteland

Basically 2 "maps", 1 enemy. Really basic POC.

Now that I've tried this out, I think I will go for something else. I like this idea, but perhaps this is where this experiment needs to end.

Note: To run locally you need to run a server to get around the CORS stuff because of the import.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Is enough to get the app to server correctly locally. Not needed for "production" (running as a page on github).
```
```
